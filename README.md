# Mark_My_Review



Reason: Sole purpose to create this was learning.

Benefits: How we give feedback/reviews in most places is by writing in their feedback book, which is neither a secure record (easily be manipulated), nor convinient 
Here in this app we can simply create our custom QR codes for each place and people can submit reviews as when they want to from wherever they want to, they are not worried of their anonymity.
